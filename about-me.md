subtitle: Supporting local farmers in Henderson County, Texas
---

My wife and I have been trying to eat more natural foods for the last few years. We do some of our own gardening, with limited success. Since moving to Athens, Texas in 2014 we have discovered some great local farmers through the Athens Farmers Market. We're happy to buy from these farmers to make up for the shortcomings in our vegetable garden. 

When some of our favorite farmers announced a CSA for 2016 we immediately signed up.
